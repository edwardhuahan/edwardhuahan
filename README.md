### Hi there 👋

I'm a computer science student at the University of Toronto and a Project Manager (former dev) at UofT Blueprint. We're a team of students that help non-profits by developing free and open source solutions.

My hobbies include game development, and I used to make games with over 200k views and 108k downloads
